type =	inherit which = [tag] value = 1/0(default)		# This country inherits country Tag, [-1] for random. Value = 1 : country will receive all units and production queue too

type = wartime_ic_mod value = X(%) 	# Additive, and ONLY applied when a country is at war. Default base value is 100%.
	

# Settings

save_date = yes / no (default); If set saves date when this event has fired and that date can be used as a trigger by other events (delay event B to fire at least X days after event A). NOTE!!! Valid event IDs range is 0 to 2,147,483,647!!!

one_action = yes / no (default); If set show just one (random) action to the player. The action is chosen based on AI chances (if present), else it is random using the same rules as for the AI (set in misc.txt).

style = 1 - allow bigger pictures to be used

# Notes

# Event actions are now only limited by screen size.

# About event AI chances calculation
   - Sum of AI chances of all valid actions could be any positive number (removed fixed sum = 100 prerequisite)
   - Invalid actions are skipped in AI chances calculations
   - Actions without specified AI chances are ignored by the AI if there is at least one valid action with AI chance set
   - If no AI chance is set for valid action, random action is chosen from all valid actions (removed increased chance to pick 1st action)

# About individual command or event actions triggers

Example :

       action = {
          name = "Test"
          trigger = { money = 100 }
          command = { trigger = { ai = yes } type = money value = 500 }
          command = { trigger = { ai = no } type = money value = -90 }
       }

# Here are some performance hints that should be taken into account when events are created

1. Triggers (no matter if these are for events, actions or commands) should be as simple as possible and these that are most likely to fail should be first.
2. If there is at least one action that has no own triggers it should be on top of the actions - that's because action triggers are now considered as continuation of the event trigger and there should be at least one valid action in order for the event to fire. Actions without triggers are considered as always valid (no matter what commands they have in opposite to 1.2/1.3).
3. If all actions has triggers, actions with triggers that are most likely to be true should be on top. This will allow for faster event validation (if main trigger is true and there is at least one valid action the event is good to go).

The following two rules have smaller impact, but as a good practice should be followed too.
4. Commands in actions should be arranged so most likely to be valid commands to be on top of the list.

    command = { type = addcore which = 300 } #Invalid for Germany. Province #300 is Berlin
    command = { type = money value = 10 } # Always valid command - good to have it on top!


5. Command without own triggers should be prioritized in commands list over these using triggers.
